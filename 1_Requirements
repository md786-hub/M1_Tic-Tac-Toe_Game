# Description
* TicTacToe 2 Players game using C programming

# Requirements
* There are many type of requirements for implementing this game 
* but here I'm manily focusing on High level and low level requirements

## High level requirements
* It should have a grid that's 3 square by 3 squares
* It must work normal as one user should assign X and other with O
* It should not announce winner untill all the boxes are full
* The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

## Low level requirements
* If all the boxes are full without having 3 boxes (up, down, across, or diagonally) with same input it should announce as game is tied
* You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares only.

## SWOT

#Strength
* The game tic-tac-toe which makes really interesting to play Owing to the nature of the rules, it is possible for the player to come up with multiple 
* strategies to conquer the game While players have to look for their turn as well as look for their opposition's strategy as well

#Weakness
* Some of the rules defined are ambiguous and might lead to confusion during game play.
* Only two player can play the game.
* Many times we are not able to find winner because it ends up in tie many times.

* The game rules can be tweaked around a little bit to make the game give result in winner or looser more frequently


#Threat
* It might not interest people as it gives tie not the winner most of the time.

#Why
* This game contributes to developmental growth in numerous ways including their understanding of predictability,
* problem solving, spatial reasoning, hand-eye coordination, turn taking, and strategizing.

#When
* Tic Tac Toe was brought to the digital world in 1952 as a game called “OXO.” Produced by Sandy Douglas,
