# Architecture
* The game is to be played between two people 
* One of the player chooses 'O' and the other 'X' to mark their respective boxes.
* The game starts with the one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has won whole row/column/diagonal filled with his/her respective character('O' or 'X')
* If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.


## Design
* In our program the moves taken by the players are chosen randomly.
* We need 9 boxes.
